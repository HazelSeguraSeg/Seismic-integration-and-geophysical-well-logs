# Seismic-integration-and-geophysical-well-logs
English:
As a school project and using petrel I carried out the complete seismic integration process with geophysical well logs, with already processed seismic data. As a result, an estimate of proven and probable reserves was chosen. All the documents are in Spanish, here is a resume of each. 

1-Theoretical bases: Is a summary of bases needed in the project. 

2-Petrel_Part_1: Based in personal interpretations of “Surfaces” the following steps were carried out in the interpretation, which are summarized in:
    Based on Surfaces make Horizons
    Make a mesh
    Apply “Geometrical Modeling”
    
  Isolate areas of interest and detail their properties such as:
    Area
    Depth
    Amplitude

3-Petrel_Part_2: Is a report of the of the decition making during the interpretation. Explaning with more detall each step.

4-Final_Report: Is the report of the integration between the sismic data and geophysical well logs, ending with the estimate of proven and probable reserves.

Spanish:
Como parte de un projecto academico y utilizando petrel realicé el proceso completo de integración sísmica con registros de pozos geofísicos, con datos sísmicos ya procesados. Como resultado se optuvo a estimación de reservas probadas y probables.
